      <h1>The Roman Artillery</h1>
      <p>Artillery was a major part of romans siege
        effects They stole most of their ideas and
        machines from greces. They would use these
        machines to devastate the fortifications of
        a castle or fortification. These machines
        could launch a projectile hundreds of yards.
        These new machines were made from metal instead
        of wood like the old versions. This would give
        them extra strength and support so they would
         last and be more efficient than ever. Some of
         the components were also covered in steel cases
         so they were not be exposed to the elements around
         them. This would make them last twice as long as
         older ones. One of these machines was called the
         stone thrower. This machine used a arm to launch
         a rock that was about 0.5 to 80 kilos. These rocks
         would fly with devastating force and would most
         certainly devastate any thing in there way. The
         second piece of artillery was a carroballista.
          This machine had to arms and looked like a massive
          crossbow. This machine could launch multiple types
          of projectiles ranging from big arrows to fire balls.
           These weapons could be used to attack cities but it
           was also helpful in defending their own city.
           The modern day militaries around the world take
           any machinery and technology they may think to be
           valuable and then reverse engineer it and use it
           against their enemies. The Chinese invented gunpowder
           and rockets. Someone found or stole the gunpowder and
           or rocket and then reverse engineered it for their own
           use. This was the way most of the world worked at one
           point, to steal and then remake it or adapt it to their
           needs. Without reverse engineering then a large part of
           the world would start to be making the Model T, mainly China
           . China just started to make good cars within the last year,
            before that they used little three wheeled things they
            called vehicles. </p>

      <h1>The Tactics of The Romans</h1>
      <p>Rome used a lot of tactics in war.
        The first tactic was called a siege.
        This is where they would block the enemy
        inside of their cities. This was good for
        Rome because they lost a lot less troops
        and would hardly have to do anything.
        To block in most cities they would have
        to build a blockade on water because most
        cities had harbers. After they had a sea
        blockade they would build a fortified camp
        around the citie. They would try to build
        these camps on hills so they could see into
        the city. By doing this they could see were
        they had water towers and secret intrenses.
        After this they would completely block any
        good or people trying to get in or out.
        Then they would weight till the city
        surrendered because they were out of
        food and water. As time continued there
        was always the chance that someone would
        open the gates because they did not like
        the conditions they were living under.
        The attacks would have to make sure that
        they were always ready for an attack on
        either side. They would do this by building
        guard towers that looked both at the front
        and back. Siege warfare is still used today.
        Modern armies will use it if they have time.
         Know a days siege warfare look a little
         different but the main concept is still
         there. Most siege warfare is used against
         people hiding in urban environments, just
         like it was used in the old days. The only
         thing that is really different is that now
         a days we can still be using artillery to
         hammer them. This notice has been around for
         a long time and does not seem to be going away
          very soon. Thanks to the Romans modern day
          armies have found a new way to defeat someone
           without having to lose many troops. </p>
